Core flow:

- User enters a URL and defines what data they want to extract (schema)
- System fetches the page content
- LLM processes the raw data and extracts structured data matching the schema
- Results are displayed in a clean, usable format

Features:

- Web server that supports CRUD operations for create/update/delete/list of scrapers.
- Scraping engine that fetches HTML from a given website and processes it with an LLM to extract structured data.
- Suitable database schema for storing scrapers (e.g SQLite).
- Next.js + React for the frontend ----> skip this for now
