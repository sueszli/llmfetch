Build a mini AI scraper that fetches HTML from a URL and structures the data with an LLM to then display the results with a simple UI.

Core flow:
- User enters a URL and defines what data they want to extract (schema)
- System fetches the page content
- LLM processes the raw data and extracts structured data matching the schema
- Results are displayed in a clean, usable format

- Implement a web server that supports CRUD operations for create/update/delete/list of scrapers.
- Create a scraping engine that fetches HTML from a given website and processes it with an LLM to extract structured data.
- Design a suitable database schema for storing scrapers (e.g SQLite).

# Frontend

- terminal user interface like htop that gives a real-time view of scraping jobs, their status, and results.
