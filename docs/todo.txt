# Backend (Deno)

Build a scraper that takes a URL, fetches the HTML, structures the data with an LLM.

Core flow:

- User enters a URL and defines what data they want to extract (schema)
- System fetches the page content
- LLM processes the raw data and extracts structured data matching the schema
  - The LLM should be local, lightweight and able to run on any consumer hardware, even with just CPUs.
  - The LLM should also be able to take advantage of the metal performance shaders of Apple Silicon chips.
- Results are displayed in a clean, usable format

Features:

- The backend should be written in Typescript with Deno.
- Take advantage of queueing mechanisms
- Implement a web server that supports CRUD operations for create/update/delete/list of scrapers.
- Create a scraping engine that fetches HTML from a given website.
  - You can use a sandbox page as an example: https://sandbox.kadoa.com/
  - Use an LLM to transform the HTML into the provided schema
- Design a suitable database schema for storing scrapers (e.g, some in-memory data structure to manage the scraping processes) and the content (SQLite or CSV directory)
- Ensure proper validation and error handling.

# Frontend (Next.js + TypeScript)

Features:

- Create a simple UI that allows creating a new scraper (e.g. URL and data schema)
- Display the results of a scraper
